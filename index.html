								<p><b>About Us</b></p>
								<p>WiraProject is a concept we came up with to bring our creative projects together into one network, including movies, apps, websites, and much more. We just decided to create something fun, and that’s how the idea was born.</p>
								<p>It all started as a fun hobby, but we quickly realized it could be something bigger. We enjoyed working together on projects, so we decided to take the idea further. WiraProject isn’t just about the projects — it’s about being part of a cool team, sharing ideas, and supporting each other.</p>
								<p><b>Our Mission</b></p>
								<p>We want to create a space where people can come together, share ideas, and work on awesome projects. It’s a place where anyone can bring their ideas to life, whether it’s a movie, app, or website.</p>
								<p><b>Our Team</b></p>
								<p>We’re just a group of friends who decided to develop this idea. We don’t have any fancy titles or professional labels — we’re just doing what we enjoy and growing together.</p>
								<p><b>What’s Next</b></p>
								<p>We have ideas and plans for the future, and we’re not stopping here. WiraProject will keep growing, and we’ll continue creating, learning, and sharing our results with the world.</p>
